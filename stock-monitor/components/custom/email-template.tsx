    <p>Hello,</p>

    <p>I really appreciate your trying out the Side Project Starter Pack!</p>

    <p>
      Although there is a subscribe button on the website, I will not send you
      any further emails, as the button was only designed as an example.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyway, if you have any question, feel free to reply to this email, and I
      will email you back!
    </p>

    <p>
      One more thing, if you want to support my work, you can fill{" "}
      <a href="https://tally.so/r/3l0jVo" target="_blank">
        the very short survey
      </a>
      . It would mean a lot to me!
    </p>

    <p>Thanks again!</p>
